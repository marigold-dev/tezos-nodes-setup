Here's a brief explanation of each setting and how you might adjust them:

1. connection-timeout: This is the maximum time the node will wait when trying to establish a connection with a peer. If the connection isn't established within this time, it will be aborted. You can increase this if you're experiencing a lot of connection timeouts, but be aware that a higher value could lead to slower detection of unresponsive peers. The default value is 10 seconds 1.

2. min-connections: This is the minimum number of connections that the node tries to maintain with its peers. If the number of active connections drops below this, the node will attempt to connect to more peers. If you're seeing "too few connections" warnings, you might want to lower this value. However, be aware that having too few connections can lead to your node becoming unsynced.

3. expected-connections: This is the number of connections that the node expects to have under normal operation. If the number of connections is below this value, the node will attempt to create new connections. If you're seeing "too few connections" warnings, you might want to lower this value. However, be aware that having too few connections can lead to your node becoming unsynced.

4. max-connections: This is the maximum number of connections that the node will maintain. If the number of connections exceeds this value, the node will start closing connections. If you're seeing "too many connections" warnings, you might want to increase this value. However, be aware that having too many connections can lead to increased resource usage.

5. max_known_points: This is the maximum number of points (i.e., potential peers) that the node will keep track of. If you're having trouble finding enough peers to connect to, you might want to increase this value. However, be aware that a larger value will lead to increased memory usage.

6. max_known_peer_ids: This is the maximum number of peer IDs that the node will remember. If you're having trouble finding enough peers to connect to, you might want to increase this value. However, be aware that a larger value will lead to increased memory usage.

The min-connections setting is directly related to the "too few connections" warning. If the number of active connections drops below this value, the node will attempt to connect to more peers.

The expected-connections setting, on the other hand, is more of a target for the node. It's the number of connections that the node expects to have under normal operation. If the number of connections is below this value, the node will attempt to create new connections, but it won't log a "too few connections" warning unless the number of connections drops below min-connections.

So, if you're seeing "too few connections" warnings, adjusting min-connections is indeed likely to have a more direct impact. However, expected-connections could still be relevant, as it controls the node's proactive behavior in establishing new connections.

The log message "too few connections" is triggered when the number of active connections falls below the min_threshold defined in the P2P layer's maintenance worker configuration. This is part of the normal operation of the P2P network maintenance system and does not directly indicate that the node is in an unsynced state.

However, if the node consistently has too few connections, it might not have a diverse enough view of the network, which could potentially impact its ability to stay accurately synced with the blockchain.

About synchronisation_threshold:
There is a default value for the synchronisation-threshold parameter. If you do not set it, the default value is 4. This is mentioned in the sync.rst in tezos/tezos.
Other values are acceptable for ``threshold``, but a small
``threshold`` (between ``2`` and ``10``; the default being ``4``) is
probably best: performances and accuracy may degrade for values much
higher than ``10``.

--> We probably want to set a decenlty high value for a Mainnet node. Whereas a low value (0 or 1 or 2) may be necessary for testnets (also depending on the testnet).
